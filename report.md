## Task 1
**Q1. The result of mapping is shuffled and sent to reducers, which could cost a lot of network traffic. Propose an approach to address this issue.**

One approach to address the high network traffic during the shuffle phase is using a combiner function. A combiner is a mini-reduce function that operates on the intermediate key-value pairs generated by the map tasks before they are sent over the network. The combiner function aggregates the data locally on the map worker, reducing the volume of data that needs to be transferred over the network.

In the MapReduce model, the combiner function can be the same as the reduce function if the operation is associative and commutative (e.g., summing word counts). By performing partial aggregation on the mapper’s local machine, the amount of intermediate data is significantly reduced, minimizing the overall network bandwidth consumption during the shuffle phase.

For example, in a word count application, instead of sending 〈word, 1〉 for every occurrence of a word, the combiner can sum these locally and only send one 〈word, count〉 per word to the reducer, greatly reducing the volume of data shuffled across the network.

**Q2. If a mapper or reducer task is too slow, which would make the whole map-reduce task very slow. Propose an approach to address this issue.**

One common approach to handle slow tasks, also known as "stragglers," is to use speculative execution. In speculative execution, when a task (either map or reduce) is taking much longer than expected to complete, the master node schedules a duplicate of that task on another worker node. The first instance to finish (either the original or the speculative task) is used, and the other one is killed.

This technique can help mitigate the effects of stragglers that slow down the entire MapReduce job due to hardware issues, network congestion, or resource contention on the worker machines. By duplicating slow tasks, speculative execution can ensure that the overall job completes faster even if some tasks are slow. This is particularly helpful when only a few tasks are slow, while the majority are completing quickly.

This approach was implemented successfully in Google's MapReduce system, as described in the paper.
